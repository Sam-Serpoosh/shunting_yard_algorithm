This is a ruby implementation of Shunting-Yard-Algorithm which
convert mathematical expressions to their post-fix format.
I tried to push as much as I can so you can track different versions
and see the differences clearly. What tests I added in each step and
what changes and Refactorings I made for DRY, more expressiveness, etc.

Hope you'll enjoy. I appreciate your great feedbacks.
